# openvpn-containered
 
I don't want to use the most popular [openvpn image of Kylemanna](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) because I'd like to learn more on the process and know exactly what's going on. While I could read into what Kylemanna did, I could create my own image in the same time.
