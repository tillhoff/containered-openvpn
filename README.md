# openvpn-containered
 
I don't want to use the most popular [openvpn image of Kylemanna](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) because I'd like to learn more on the process and to know exactly what's going on. While I could also read into what Kylemanna did, I could also create my own image and have way more fun.
